Welcome to OpenVE-2db, A free, Open Source, and lightweight game engine.
Created By OpenVentura.
Version 1.0 - Released Apr.2024

MADE USING : (estimate)
  Python 3.12 - 95%
  Bash Script - 5%

A BASH TERMINAL IS REQUIRED TO CREATE NEW PROJECTS

Required Applications :
  Python 3.12 or newer
  OpenVE Source Code
  A text editor with RenPy Support (VS Code Works)
  Python Shell (recommend: IDLE)
  A Bash shell (NOT A VM, recommend: Cygwin, WSL)

Required Libraries :
  os : 'Necessary to create projects from templates'
  OpenVE_Py : 'so that scenes compile correct' (this is included if you downloaded from the git)
  sys : 'for a few non-vital commands'
  pygame : 'for display handeling'


[----------DEVELOPER-NOTES----------]
This isn't really a complicated game engine, It is basically a bunch of presets I made, that are then compiled into PyGame.
The Idea is very Similar to RenPy Engine

[----------COMPATIBILLITY-NOTES----------]
THIS HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED ON WINDOWS 10
Theoretically, since this is 100% made in Python, It can run on MacOS and Linux.
However, I cannot Guarantee it will work.

[----------DOCUMENTATION----------]
Due to how long it would take to Write a full Documentation webpage,
I decided to leave the project Open-Source, So you can figure it out yourself.
